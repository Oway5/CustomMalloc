Your test plan

Descriptions of your test programs (including arguments), 
- Task 1 - malloc() and immediately free() a 1-byte object, 120 times
- Task 2 - Use malloc() to get 120 1-byte objects, storing the pointers in an array, then use free() to deallocate the chunks
- Task 3 - Create an array of 120 pointers. Repeatedly make a random choice between allocating a 1-byte object and adding the pointer to the array and deallocating a previously allocated object (if any), until you have allocated 120 times. Deallocate any remaining objects.
- Task 4 - Allocate 7 byte objects repeatedly 120 times and free them.
- Task 5 - Allocate a value to my pointer from a variable and print it.
